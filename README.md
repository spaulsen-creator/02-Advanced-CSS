## Project Description 

A simple website created for users who want to hike around Denver featuring 16 different hikes.  When the user clicks on a certain hike, the users will be able to see the location on the map provided and given a link for more information on that specific hike.  If the user navigates to another page, the last hike searched will be saved on the map if the user returns to search for more hikes.
