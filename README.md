## Set portfolio for Web Content Accessibility and designed with a mobile-first mindset:
* Set "viewport" through a meta tag added for multiple device usage.
* Added alt attribute to all img tags for image text if image cannot be displayed.
## HTML code was designed to employ clean semantics and structure.
* anchor tags with href were used on active links.
* As there were no other projects available at this time a hover property was added in css for the remainder.
* Images were styled and a touch of styling was added to the text used.
* I do expect the layout to change from a design standpoint as knowledge increases.
## CSS code used for basic design and styling.
* Changed class to .benefits to reduce 3 portions of css styling.
* Changed class to .benefits h3 to reduce 3 portions of css styling.
* Changed class to .benefits img to reduce 3 portions of css styling.
* Changed class to .departments to reduce 3 portions of css styling.
